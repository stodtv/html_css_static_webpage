This program was a 1st year final project for my Web development class.

It is a simple static website utilizing HTML and CSS. There is an aside panel, a table, images, menu with buttons that change colors on hover and various simple techniques of modifying text and the layout of the webpages.

index.html is the homepage, although with this specific project it doesn't matter what .html file is opened first.
